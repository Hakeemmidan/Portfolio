<p>I thought this was interesting, and I had so many questions, including:</p>

<li><a href="#how-come-the-fish-are-so-organized">How come the fish are so organized?</a></li>

<li><a href="#what-type-of-fish-do-they-mostly-catch">What type of fish do they mostly catch?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Below, I attempt to answer each question.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="do-they-catch-them-all-in-one-scoop">Do they catch them all in one scoop?</h3>
<p>According to this <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v520/p257-267/">Oxford University study</a>, the answer is no. Puffins make multiple dives per hunt (a.k.a. bout), catching about 1 fish in each dive. They average about 25 dives per hunt.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-come-the-fish-are-so-organized">How come the fish are so organized?</h3>
<p>According to BBC, in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3DlgWjmWQg2qBYLY1J0vFgN/thirteen-proper-puffin-facts">this article</a>, puffins stack fish in their beaks using a combination of their tounge and beaks.</p>
<p>Their beaks contain &lsquo;tentacles&rsquo;, which are like small teeth that keep the fish in place. And they use their tounges to push up existing fish while openning their mouths to catch new ones.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="do-they-hide-their-food-while-catching-other-fish-why-do-other-birds-not-steal-them">Do they hide their food while catching other fish? Why do other birds not steal them?</h3>
<p>Once puffins catch a fish they keep it in their mouth. So this shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, unless other birds literally steal the food off their mouths. And according to <a href="https://portlandpress.com/biochemist/article/32/6/54/810/Catching-nature-What-s-on?searchresult=1">this article</a>, that actually has happened before, where seagulls (of course it&rsquo;s damn seagulls) were witnessed trying to steal food of a puffin&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="is-this-a-flex">Is this a &lsquo;flex&rsquo;?</h3>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_puffin#Reproduction">mating/courtship protocol</a> doesn&rsquo;t usually involve fish. But since I haven&rsquo;t found too much evidence of that, I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s up for investigation!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-type-of-fish-do-they-mostly-catch">What type of fish do they mostly catch?</h3>
<p>According to this <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v520/p257-267/">Oxford University study</a>, they mostly feed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_eel">sand eel</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="side-note">Side note:</h3>
<p>While looking into this, I found out that there&rsquo;s another type of bird that stacks fish in their beak! The bird&rsquo;s name is the Razorbill (a.k.a. Alca torda). Here is a picture of it carrying fish like a puffin:</p>

<p>But according to <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v520/p257-267/">this study</a> (the same Oxford study mentioned above) puffins do tend to carry more fish overall. Razorbills can carry 2 to 10 fish, whereas puffins can carry up to 50!</p>
