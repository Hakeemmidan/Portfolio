      <description>Hi, Iâ€™m Hakeem. I have experience building full-stack applications in many languages and frameworks. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over time is that the main mental challenge often lies in the logic behind what you are building, and not in the language/framework itself.
Outside of work, I enjoy painting, playing volleyball, soccer, scuba diving, and hanging out with friends. I also enjoy reading about business and finance.
I am currently looking for software engineering and finance positions and I would love to hear about your company!</description>
