      <description>Have you ever noticed that puffins often simultaneously carry multiple fish in their beaks at once?
It&amp;rsquo;d be something like this:  Source   I thought this was interesting, and I had so many questions, including:
 Do they catch them all in one scoop? How come the fish are so organized? Do they hide their food while catching other fish? Why do other birds not steal them? Is this a &amp;lsquo;flex&amp;rsquo;?</description>

      <description>Problem The slightest change in CSS animations (@keyframes) requires a creation of a new animation.
Problem Example @keyframes to-yellow { 50% { background-color: yellow; } } @keyframes to-skyblue { 50% { background-color: skyblue; } } Both of the animations pretty much do the same thing, but we had to create two of them. We had to create two of them because their property (background-color) had different values (i.e. yellow and skyblue).</description>

      <description>What are static websites? In simple terms, static websites are a collection of webpages that have fixed content. They are the most basic type of website and are typically considered the easiest to create.
These websites are considered the easiest to create because they have a low barrier of entry. They are usually not connected to a backend or a database, so the only thing that you will need to manage is the frontend.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Abdulhakeem. You can call me Hakeem. I have experience building full-stack applications in many languages and frameworks. What I’ve learned over time is that the main mental challenge often lies in the logic behind what you&amp;rsquo;re building, and not in the language/framework itself.
Outside of work, I enjoy painting, playing volleyball, soccer, scuba diving, and hanging out with friends. I also enjoy reading about business and finance.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently looking for software engineering and finance positions and I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about your company!</description>
